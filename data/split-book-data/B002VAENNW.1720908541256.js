window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The US Speaker of the House is assassinated in a terrifyingly precise execution in the heart of Washington, DC. In a quieter corner of the nation's capital, the rare book room of the Library of Congress, a reclusive, wealthy scholar drops dead under mysterious circumstances that leave no clues. Following on the heels of the natural death of the Speaker of the House, the city and the nation begin to tremble. In California, a beautiful but capable woman is planning and executing one of the most brilliant cons on record. </p> <p>All the while, \"Oliver Stone\" and his quirky Camel Club stand by and observe as the genius of their collective perspective begins to connect the dots between these seemingly disparate events - and they realize they must act, and act quickly, before their country falls victim to a silent yet bloody coup. </p>";
