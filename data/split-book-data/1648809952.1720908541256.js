window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bransen Garibond, the Highwayman, had little interest in the politics of Honce. To him, the two powerful warring lairds were the same sides of the same coin: The outcome for the people would be no different either way.</p> <p>A journey north, however, teaches Bransen that his views are simplistic at best...and that some things truly matter.</p> <p>Joined by his comrades in arms from The Ancient, Bransen sets off on a quest to put right over wrong and to find the truth, both of Honce and of himself. But his search is fraught with confusion and fraud - for there are many who would seek to use the Highwayman's extraordinary battle skills and popularity for their own nefarious ends.</p> <p>Performed by Dylan Lynch, Christopher Scheeren, Terence Aselford, Bradley Smith, Nanette Savard, Michael Glenn, Mort Shelby, Patrick Bussink, Steven Carpenter, Colleen Delany, David Coyne, Dan Sontagg, Nick DePinto, Thomas Keegan, Michael John Casey, James Keegan, Johann Dettweiler, Yazmin Tuazon, Alyssa Wilmoth, Kimberly Gilbert, Thomas Penny, Eric Messner, Ken Jackson, Scott McCormick, Drew Kopas, Christopher Graybill, Ren Casey, Joe Brack, James Lewis, Karen Novak, Evan Casey, Richard Rohan, Gary Telles.</p>";
