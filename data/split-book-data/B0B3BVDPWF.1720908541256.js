But what good is that if the one person he cares for is stuck in another world?</b></p> <p>Sickly and starved back home, Aegis is stripped of his memory when transported to the magical land of Strathmar. His new body aches as he arises as a noob warrior lost and confused. Though one thing is certain…an uncanny strength flows through him like never before.</p> <p>With a shield as his weapon and a bleeding heart as his curse, Aegis starts his journey by taking beatings that no man ever should to protect those in need.
