window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After years as a court magician and interdimensional hero, Skeeve needed a rest. So he took some time off to study magic and relax. When a few months later several members of the M.Y.T.H. Inc. Team each ask him to train some talented, young magicians in \"practical magic\", he has to agree. But after the assassins attack and a manticore tries to eat them, the Khlad mage soon discovers that there is more going on than learning. His students are preparing for a very deadly magical game, and you won't believe where. Worse yet, the game may be fixed, and the only way to save his students' lives is for Skeeve to risk his own.</p>";
