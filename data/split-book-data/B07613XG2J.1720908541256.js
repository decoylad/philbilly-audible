window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Today the names of H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, August Derleth, and Clark Ashton Smith, all regular contributors to the pulp magazine <i>Weird Tales</i> during the first half of the 20th century, are recognizable even to casual audiences of the bizarre and fantastic. And yet despite being more popular than them all during the golden era of genre pulp fiction, there is another author whose name and work have fallen into obscurity: Seabury Quinn. </p> <p>Quinn's short stories were featured in well more than half of <i>Weird Tales</i>' original publication run. His most famous character, the supernatural French detective Dr. Jules de Grandin, investigated cases involving monsters, devil worshippers, serial killers, and spirits from beyond the grave, often set in the small town of Harrisonville, New Jersey. Collected for the first time, <i>The Complete Tales of Jules de Grandin</i>, edited by George Vanderburgh, presents all 93 published works featuring the supernatural detective. Presented in chronological order, this is the definitive collection of an iconic pulp hero. </p>";
