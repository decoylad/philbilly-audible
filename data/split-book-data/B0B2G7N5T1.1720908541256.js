I work as a PI out of the Nightside, that secret center of London where clocks always read three AM, where terrible things happen with predictable regularity, and where the always-dark streets are full of people partying like Judgement Day will never come.</p> <p>Now it may have arrived. God's own enforcer, the righteous engine of destruction known as the Walking Man, has come to the Nightside. He's a being whose sole purpose is the elimination of the wicked and the guiltyâ€”and given the nature of the Nightside, there's a good chance that once he gets started, he'll just keep on until there's no one left.</p> <p>So the Authorities have hired me to stop him. Legend has it that he can't be killed. I'm very much hoping that the legend isn't true . . .</p>";
