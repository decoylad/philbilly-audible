window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Itâ€™s the autumn of 1890, and a spate of bombings has hit London. The newspapers are full of fevered speculation about anarchists, antimonarchists and Fenians. But one man suspects an even more sinister hand behind the violence. </p> <p>Sherlock Holmes believes Professor Moriarty is orchestrating a nationwide campaign of terror, but to what end? At the same time, a bizarrely garbed figure has been spotted on the rooftops and in the grimy back alleys of the capital. </p> <p>He moves with the extraordinary agility of a latter-day Spring-heeled Jack. He possesses weaponry and armor of unprecedented sophistication. He is known only by the name Baron Cauchemar, and he appears to be a scourge of crime and villainy. But is this masked man truly the force for good that he seems? Is he connected somehow to the bombings? </p> <p>Holmes and his faithful companion Dr. Watson are about to embark on one of their strangest and most exhilarating adventures yet.</p>";
