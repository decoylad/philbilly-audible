window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Quick, cutting wit...a keen ear.\"--</b><b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p>Hollywood’s newest wunderkind is Peter Alan Nelsen, the brilliant, erratic director known as the King of Adventure.</p> <p>His films make billions, but his manners make enemies. What the boy king wants, he gets, and what Nelsen wants is for Elvis to comb the country for the wife and infant child the film-school flunkout dumped en route to becoming the third-biggest filmmaker in America. It’s the kind of case Cole can handle in his sleep - until it turns out to be a nightmare. For when Cole finds Nelsen’s ex-wife in a small Connecticut town, she’s nothing like he expects. She has some unwanted - and very nasty - mob connections, which means Elvis could be opening an East Coast branch of his P.I. office...at the bottom of the Hudson River.</p> <p><b>\"Elvis [Cole] is the greatest...[ he is] perhaps the best detective to come along since Travis McGee.\"--</b><b><i>San Diego Tribune</i></b></p> <p><b>\"[Crais is] far better at the private-eye-novel racket than most writers.\"--</b><b><i>Newsweek</i></b></p>";
