window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A soldier with a past meets a future he cannot ignore. The Queen’s Blade saga begins.</b></p><p>Zaren Joha, once a formidable soldier, now spends his days maintaining peace in a quiet tavern in Lavrun. No more military rigors. No more blind obedience. The job is uneventful, yet it allows him a semblance of normalcy.</p><p>But his tranquil life in Lavrun is about to change. An encounter with the mysterious Waleith, a man with deep connections to the queen, draws him into a world where his brawn is not enough. The tavern's usual hustle, the sailors' brawls, and the regulars are soon overshadowed by a brewing storm of magic and intrigue attempting to topple the throne.</p><p>As Zaren grapples with powers beyond his understanding and confronts the echoes of a magic-tainted past, survival in this new world demands more than physical strength. To protect those he has come to care for and to navigate the treacherous currents of royal politics and ancient magic, Zaren must embrace a role he never anticipated.</p><p>No longer a soldier, he must become the Queen’s Blade.</p>";
