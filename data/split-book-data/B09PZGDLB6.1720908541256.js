I work the garish streets of the Nightside - the hidden heart of London where it's always three a.m., where inhuman creatures and otherworldly gods walk side by side in the endless darkness of the soul.</p> <p>I have a talent for finding things. People...property...no problem. But now I'm after something different.</p> <p>A local diva called the Nightingale has cut herself off from her family and friends, and I've been hired to find out the reason. I'm also wondering why her suicide-prone fans think she has a voice to die for. Literally.</p> <p>To get the truth, I'll have to lend an ear to the most enticingly beautiful and deadly voice in all of the Nightside - and survive.</p>";
