window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the wasteland, you do whatever you can to survive....</p> <p>Even after the bombs fell, even after countries unleashed weapons beyond imagination on one another, even after lawlessness became the norm, people still expect their mail.</p> <p>As a deadman, I'm uniquely suited to deliver it.</p> <p>Rads don't bother me, and people who try to hurt me typically wind up dead. Sure, humans may not like dealing with a face like mine, but hey not like youâ€™ve got many options here in the wastes.</p> <p>But one day in the middle of my route, I come upon a new job and maybe the opportunity to start thriving instead of surviving.</p> <p><i>Deadman </i>is a <i>Fallout</i>-inspired apocalyptic LitRPG about a courier braving the irradiated wasteland. Featuring a weird west vibe, a detailed system, gunfights galore, radiation mutants, saloons, and endless adventure, it's perfect for fans of <i>Fallout</i>,<i> Mad Max</i>, and <i>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Deadman</i>.</p>";
