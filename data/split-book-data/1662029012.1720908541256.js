window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fleeing some unsavory doings in her hometown of Charlotte, Jenna accepts her uncle's gracious invitation to stay with him in small-town Hokes Folly, North Carolina. In exchange, she'll help him out in his antiquarian bookstore. But soon after she arrives, Jenna finds her uncle's body crumpled at the base of the staircase between his apartment and the bookstore.</p> <p>Before the tragedy even sinks in, Jenna learns that she's inherited almost everything her uncle owned: the store and the apartment as well as his not-so-meager savings and the payout from a life-insurance policy...which adds up to more than a million dollars. This is all news to Jenna - bad news, once the police get wind of her windfall. And it’s an ill wind indeed, as a second murder cements Jenna's status as the prime suspect in both deaths.</p> <p>Jenna can hit the road again, taking her chances that she can elude trouble along the way, or she can stick it out in Hokes Folly, take over the bookstore, and try to sleuth out her uncle's killer. On the one hand, she's made some wonderful new friends, and she feels she can thrive in the genial small-town environment. On the other hand, trouble knows her address - and so does the killer, who is determined to write the final page of her story.</p>";
