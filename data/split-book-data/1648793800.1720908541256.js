window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Necromancer is such an ugly word, but it's a title Eric Carter is stuck with.</p> <p>He sees ghosts, talks to the dead. He's turned it into a lucrative career, putting troublesome spirits to rest, sometimes taking on even more dangerous things. For a fee, of course.</p> <p>When he left LA 15 years ago, he thought he'd never go back. Too many bad memories. Too many people trying to kill him.</p> <p>But now his sister's been brutally murdered and Carter wants to find out why.</p> <p>Was it the gangster looking to settle a score? The ghost of a mage he killed the night he left town? Maybe it's the patron saint of violent death herself, Santa Muerte, who's taken an unusually keen interest in him.</p> <p>Carter's going to find out who did it, and he's going to make them pay.</p> <p>As long as they don't kill him first.</p> <p>Performed by Michael John Casey, Eva Wilhelm, Jacob Yeh, Tia Shearer, Terence Aselford, Jefferson A Russell, Gabriela Fernandez-Coffey, James Lewis, Michael Glenn, James Konicek, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Nick DePinto, Rebecca Sheir, Jonathon Church, Thomas Keegan, Bradley Smith, Matthew Bassett, Ken Jackson, Dawn Ursula.</p>";
