window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Skeeve is feeling rather restless and suddenly remembers the treasure map he bought on his last adventure. Knowing Aahz's lust for money, he shows him the map. Quicker than a Deveel at the Bazaar of Deva can take your possessions, they were off to find the Golden Cow! There were a few problems, aren't there always. Tanda decides that she is in on the hunt; for a share, of course. Since Aahz is not too up on vortexes, just dimensions, they have to visit a shifter at the Bazaar for directions—he/she/it gets a five-percent cut of the treasure for each time they have to visit him/her/it. (Want to guess how many times our heroes are led astray?)</p>";
