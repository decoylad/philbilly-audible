window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the number-one best-selling author of <i>One More Last Time!</i> </p> <p>Just yesterday, Ben was a petty criminal getting by on fleecing New York’s one-percenters. Today, he's got a new face, a new name, and a new world to navigate. And Ben’s thinking maybe this time around, he’ll use his skills at disarming and deceiving to help out people other than himself. Maybe. </p> <p>Watching a medieval City Guard fight off a 20-foot-tall ooze that crawled up from the sewers will make you think twice about life decisions. Tomorrow, he'll need to save a girl, steal a crown, join a guild, and most importantly, convince an innkeep to make a decent bacon egg and cheese. </p> <p><i>Scamps and Scoundrels</i> is the witty, action-packed entree into The Bad Guys, a new series from epic LitRPG writer Eric Ugland. If you like immersive world-building full of magic, monsters, and mischief, this is the book for you.</p>";
