window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ishmael Jones investigates a haunted house...but is haunted by his own past in the latest of this quirky paranormal mystery series. </p> <p>\"That house is a bad place. Bad things happen there....\"</p> <p>Set high on top of Widows Hill, Harrow House has remained empty for years. Now, on behalf of an anonymous prospective buyer, Ishmael and Penny are spending a night there in order to investigate the rumors of strange lights, mysterious voices, unexplained disappearances, and establish whether the house is really haunted. </p> <p>What really happened at Harrow House all those years ago? Joined by a celebrity psychic, a professional ghost-hunter, a local historian, and a newspaper reporter, it becomes clear that each member of 'Team Ghost' has their own pet theory as to the cause of the alleged haunting. But when one of the group suddenly drops dead with no obvious cause, Ishmael realizes that if he can find out how and why the victim died, he will have the key to solving the mystery. </p> <p>Performed by Scott McCormick, Laura C. Harris, Jason Keller, Kay Elúvian, Katie Leigh, John Kielty, Torian Brackett, Peter Holdway, Jillian Levine-Sisson, and Matthew Pauli.</p>";
