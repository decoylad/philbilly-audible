window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Resistance is fractured. The remaining survivors are buckling under the might of the malicious Tyrant King. Enter Roark von Graf, hedge mage, lesser noble of Traisbin, and one of the last freedom fighters. Desperate and unhinged, Roark crafts one final attempt to overthrow the king. The plan goes awry, and Roark finds himself tumbling headfirst into an interdimensional portal. On the other side, he finds himself stranded in an unexpected place - an ultra-immersive fantasy video game called <i>Hearthworld</i>. Worse yet, he's taken the form of a low-level troll. Luckily, Roark managed to grab a powerful magic artifact that could defeat the king. It might not be game over after all.</p> <p>Dungeon Masters James Hunter and eden Hudson form an alliance with Audie award winner Nick Podehl and invite you to gear up with this new series. Get ready to level up, because this time the game is real. </p>";
