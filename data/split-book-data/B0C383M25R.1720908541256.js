window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You'll hate him too; Until you don't. . .</p> <p>This is the story of Dan—a high school dropout who plays guitar in a heavy metal band and has a minimum wage job wearing a mouse costume. He's not exactly destined for great things.</p> <p>Then Dan wakes up in another world—a world where science never progressed past the Middle Ages, and the laws of physics have been replaced by role-playing game rules. Dan makes some mistakes—some big mistakes. Dan becomes a Death Knight: a walking personification of death and darkness.</p> <p>Now, Dan must fight monsters, zealots, and demons just to survive, and he must do it all alone—because everybody hates Death Knights.</p>";
