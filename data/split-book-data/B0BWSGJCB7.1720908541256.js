Immune to its machinations, he is Fateless.</p> <p>So, when he inadvertently disrupts his best friends summoning into another world, the Gods offer him a choice. Fix the mistake, or sentence said friend and world he's destined to save to a particularly nasty end.</p> <p>Reborn into a new world in the body of Minotaur, Graeme will have to survive frozen wastes, vicious slavers, and perilous dungeons. All whilst adapting to strange game-like powers, delivered and explained to him by an overly enthusiastic voice in his head.</p> <p>It's not all bad news though. Sure he might be the only Scotsman he knows with horns, but this lack of Fate seems to come with some benefits. The ability to wreak havoc with the pre-ordained plans of the Gods might just give him the edge he needs.</p> <p>Guess the pint will have to wait.</p>";
