window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Mick Oberon may look like just another 1930s private detective, but beneath the fedora and the overcoat, he’s got pointy ears and he’s packing a wand. </b></p> <p>Mick is suffering from bad luck, and when luck is your chief magical weapon, that means things are pretty dire. Hunting for the origin of his bad mojo, Mick finds himself on the trail of a missing mummy, and being trailed by some of the most dangerous mobsters in Chicago. As well as once again embroiled in the maneuverings of the seductive and lethal Ramona Webb and her mysterious employer. </p> <p>All Mick knows for sure is that, until he can figure out precisely what’s going on, he’s vulnerable. And the threat, whatever it is and from whatever direction it may be coming, is very, very real.</p> <p>Performed by Eric Messner, Nora Achrati, Elizabeth Jernigan, Chris Genebach, Tia Shearer, Terence Aselford, Nick DePinto, Michael John Casey, Kimberly Gilbert, Paul Reisman, Richard Rohan, Bob Payne, Bradley Smith, Ren Kasey, Tim Carlin, Catherine Aselford, Ken Jackson, Elliot Dash, David Jourdan, Christopher Graybill, Delores King Williams, Scott McCormick, Nathanial Perry, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Mort Shelby, Nanette Savard.</p>";
