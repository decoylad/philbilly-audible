window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Today the names of H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, August Derleth, and Clark Ashton Smith, all regular contributors to the pulp magazine Weird Tales during the first half of the twentieth century, are recognizable even to casual readers of the bizarre and fantastic. And yet despite being more popular than them all during the golden era of genre pulp fiction, there is another author whose name and work have fallen into obscurity: Seabury Quinn.</p> <p>Quinn's short stories were featured in well over half of Weird Tales's original publication run. His most famous character, the French supernatural detective Dr. Jules de Grandin, investigated cases involving monsters, devil worshippers, serial killers, and spirits from beyond the grave, often set in the small town of Harrisonville, New Jersey. In de Grandin there are familiar shades of both Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, and alongside his assistant, Dr. Samuel Trowbridge, de Grandin's knack for solving mysteries captivated people for nearly three decades.</p> <p>The Complete Tales of Jules de Grandin collects all ninety-three published works featuring the supernatural detective. The fifth volume, Black Moon, includes all the stories from \"Suicide Chapel\" (1938) to \"The Ring of Bastet\" (1951).</p>";
