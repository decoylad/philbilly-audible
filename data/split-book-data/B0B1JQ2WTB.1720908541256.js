window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The game is on. Time is ticking. Somebody is rigging the deck.</b></p> <p>Carl and his bottom-scraper minions were a success story from any perspective. Against all odds, they managed to defeat all of Carl's dragon siblings and kill the filthy Soul Carver. Now, all that is left for him to do is take up the comfy place as the rightful ruler of the Scoured Mountain. With that out of the way, Selys the dragon matriarch can retire and go do whatever she feels like.</p> <p>Small issue: \"Whatever Selys feels like\" turns out to be world domination. Even though Carl isn't native to this world, unleashing fiery wings of doom upon the world seems impolite. There's no such thing as a free lunch, especially in this world. If he wants to be the true ruler of the Scoured Mountain, Carl will have to fight to earn his keep. If he survives, there is still the question of a questionable magical oath to be sworn to Selys.</p> <p>The situation is spiraling out of control for Carl and his people. A crossroads looms ahead of them: choose guaranteed survival...or pick a fight they're destined to lose.</p>";
