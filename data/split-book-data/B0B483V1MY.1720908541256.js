For those foolish enough to seek it out, it's a literal tourist trap, populated by beings, human and otherwise, who have never seen the sun rise. A place where your dreams can come true—as long as your nightmares don't get you first.</p> <p>My name is John Taylor. I'm a PI with a special talent for finding lost things. I'm also the reluctant owner of a very special—and dangerous—weapon: Excalibur, the legendary sword (which isn't what you think it is, and never was). Excalibur chose me, and to find out why, I'll have to consult the last defenders of Camelot, a group of knights who dwell in a place that some find more frightening than the Nightside.</p> <p>London Proper. It's been years since I've been back-and there are good reasons for that....</p>";
