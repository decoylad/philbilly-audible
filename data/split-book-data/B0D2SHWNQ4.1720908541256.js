window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Listen to the wholesome, incredible LitRPG series that remains a fan favorite - now with DUAL narration! Harvey killed the World Boss. Now he must clean up the mess.</p> <p>On the cusp of a second lease on life, Harvey, Tabitha, Maywen, and Reacher have one goal: to level up before the World Boss regenerates. Lorith is alive again, but the remnants of centuries of toxic magic pollution linger. The world needs more healing than even someone with a Legendary class can administer, not at level 3 anyway.</p> <p>Between monsters and mysterious villains, Harvey must confront a cruel reality. Will he be content to let those he cares about defend him, or will he embrace his destiny and become the Master of Steel.</p> <p>Master of Steel is the transformational sequel of the dungeonpunk/steampunk first entry in the series, Father of Constructs.</p>";
