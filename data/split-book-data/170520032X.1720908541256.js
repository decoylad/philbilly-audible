They learn through the Ancients that one of their kind, the Paladin Bergen Olgitram, along with his band of mercenaries, the Blue Cohorts, are being besieged within the Brazen City by the headstrong Sun Emperor. Not only do Ahren and his companions need to get to the Sunplains in double-quick time and protect the Brazen City with its invaluable forges, but they also have to persuade the city triumvirate that a peaceful resolution to the conflict is paramount. And if that's not challenging enough, the Sun Emperor is determined to have the renegade captain and his mercenaries put to death. But Jorath needs every one of the 13 Paladins in its war against HIM, WHO FORCES. Even if one them is frustratingly stubborn. </p> <p>The saga of the 13th Paladin continues. Join him and his friends on their adventures in the Sunplains and enjoy meeting his old friends in Deepstone again.</p>";
