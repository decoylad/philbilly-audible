When Ahaz takes exception to something Skeeve says, he walks away from M.Y.T.H., Inc. and goes back to Perv. Skeeve realizes that he must apologize for his thoughtless behavior and convince his stubborn, thin-skinned cohort to rejoin the firm - and finds himself trapped in the most demonic dimension of them all! </p> <p>Welcoming committee....</p> <p>“Nice of you to drop by, mister!” That was said by a Pervect, one of six who were blocking our path down the alley. “Of course, you know this here’s what you’d call a toll-alley. You got to pay to use it.” “That’s right,” one of his cronies chimed in. “We figure what you got in your pockets ought to cover it.” I decided that this would be an excellent time to delegate a problem. “C’mon Kalvin! Do something!” “Like what? I told you I’m no good in a fight.” “Well, do something! You’re supposed to be the Djin!” “Oh, all right!” he grimaced. “Maybe this will help.” With that, he made a few passes with his hands and...and I was stone-cold sober! “That’s all I can do for you,” he shrugged. “At least now you won’t have to fight ‘em drunk.”</p>";
