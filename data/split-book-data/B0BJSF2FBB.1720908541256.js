window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Audiobook of book two in the breakout hit series Portal to Nova Roma is now available! With more than 16 million pages read on Kindle Unlimited, thousands of Kindle copies sold, and 3,400+ ratings with a 4.7 star average, make sure to pick up the sequel today! </p> <p>Alexander and his growing legion have managed to escape Nova Roma and, more importantly, learned that the rest of the world may not be as ravaged by monsters as they had all thought. Join them as they set sail for ancient Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, to try to learn more about the wider world outside Nova Roma. Along the way, they'll encounter a growing plague of deadly pirates, deceitful old merchant families out to quash any new competitors in the region, mysterious new allies, and much more. </p> <p>Just as Alexander is starting to feel hope that humanity may actually survive, something happens to tear him away from everyone and everything he has come to care about. Lost, shackled, and without the majority of his skills, Alexander will be forced to confront a new side of himself, a darker, more violent side that threatens to take control of his mind and the new powers he has managed to craft for himself. If he can't learn to resist the growing corruption of his mind, he may not just be a danger to himself and those he cares about, but may become a danger to the very world itself. </p> <p>Audiobook narrated by the wonderful Christian J. Gilliland.</p>";
