window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sherlock Holmes is an unparalleled genius who uses the gift of deduction and reason to solve the most vexing of crimes.<br> <br> Warlock Holmes, however, is an idiot. A good man, perhaps; a font of arcane power, certainly. But he’s brilliantly dim. Frankly, he couldn’t deduce his way out<br> of a paper bag. The only things he has really got going for him are the might of a thousand demons and his stalwart flatmate. Thankfully, Dr. Watson is always<br> there to aid him through the treacherous shoals of Victorian propriety … and save him from a gruesome death every now and again.<br> <br> An imaginative, irreverent and addictive reimagining of the world’s favourite detective, Warlock Holmes retains the charm, tone and feel of the original stories<br> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle while finally giving the flat at 221b Baker Street what it’s been missing for all these years: an alchemy table.<br> <br> Reimagining six stories, this riotous mashup is a glorious new take on the ever-popular Sherlock Holmes myth, featuring the vampire Inspector Vladislav<br> Lestrade, the ogre Inspector Torg Grogsson, and Dr. Watson, the true detective at 221b. And Sherlock. A warlock.</p>";
