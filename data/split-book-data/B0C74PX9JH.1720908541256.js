window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sword versus claw. Shield against fire. The knight rises to challenge the wild dragon.</b><br> <br> Carl and his armies of non-humans barely managed to fend off the human army attacking the Scoured Mountain last time. That’s how it’s supposed to go, according to the stories. It’s supposed to be Man-o-a-dragon-o. Only…the Nefren Empire never got that memo. Now the bloody two-legged smooth skins are back, with reinforcements.<br> <br> Until now, the forces of the mountain have always been divided. Either by species, belief, or just plain mentality. All of that has changed thanks to Carl. He has managed to gather all the large bestial groupings under his banner, and the human armies are going to run face-first into a united mountain. The full might of the human empire, pitted against a multitude of monstrous beasts backed by a Blessing of the goddess Deyra.<br> <br> It would appear to be a fair fight. If only there weren’t so many blasted <i>humans</i>.</p>";
