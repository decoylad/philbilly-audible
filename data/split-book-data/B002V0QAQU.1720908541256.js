window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A thoughtful and powerful page turner.\"--</b><b><i>People</i></b></p> <p>Elvis Cole is just a detective who can't say no, especially to a girl in a terrible fix. And Jennifer Sheridan qualifies: Her fianc√©, Mark Thurman, is a decorated LA cop with an elite plainclothes unit, but Jennifer's sure he's in trouble - the kind of serious trouble that only Elvis Cole can help him out of.</p> <p>Five minutes after his new client leaves his office, Elvis and his partner, the enigmatic Joe Pike, are hip-deep in a deadly situation as they plummet into a world of South Central gangs, corrupt cops, and conspiracies of silence. And before the case is through, every copy in the LAPD will be gunning for a pair of escaped armed-and-dangerous killers - Elvis Cole and Joe Pike.</p> <p><b>\"Elvis Cole provides more fun for the reader than any L.A. private eye to come along in years.\"--Joseph Wambaugh</b></p> <p><b>\"Elvis lives, and he's on his way to being crowned the king of detectives.\"--</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b></p>";
