window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sixth book of this dark urban fantasy series follows necromancer Eric Carter through a world of vengeful gods and goddesses, mysterious murders, and restless ghosts.</p> <p>The Necromancer is dead. Long live the Necromancer.</p> <p>After being attacked by a demon in the one place he thought he was safe, Eric Carter has been killed, his soul sent to take its place as a stand-in for the Aztec god of death Mictlantecuhtli. But somebody on Earth isn't done with him, yet. Somebody with the power to bring him back from the dead. He doesn't know who, and worse he doesn't know why.</p> <p>Between an angry death goddess, family secrets steeped in blood, a Djinn who's biding his time, and a killer mage who can create copy after copy of himself, Eric's new life looks to be just as violent as his last one. But if he doesn't get to the bottom of why he's back, it's going to be a hell of a lot shorter.</p> <p>Performed by Michael John Casey, Nora Achrati, Dawn Ursula, James Lewis, Rana Kay, Shanta Parasuraman, Nick DePinto, Scott McCormick, Terence Aselford, Kay Eluvian, Richard Rohan, Tia Shearer, Amanda Forstrom, Alejandro Ruiz, Yasmin Tuazon, Alexandra Cohler, Karen Novack, Marni Penning, Elias Khalil, Ken Jackson, Colleen Delany, Rayner Gabriel, Ryan Haugen, Andrew Quilpa, Ryan Carlo Dalusung, Eric Messner, Samantha Cooper, and Eva Wilhelm.</p>";
