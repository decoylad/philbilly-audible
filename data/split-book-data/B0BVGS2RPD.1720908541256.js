Imperial spymaster Croesus is sending his top team to Greece on a personal assignment: find out why the Oracle of Delphi betrayed him and how it engineered the death of his son and heir.</p> <p>But to reach Delphi, Samuel and Mehrnaz will first have to fight myth-obsessed pirates, charm a ship of women smugglers, wrestle Spartans in a death match, and outwit amorous Athenians. And at the Oracle, they must face their true opponents: the descendants of a long-dead empire of evil who, in service to their infernal lord, are determined to bring bloody chaos to the whole world.</p> <p>Olympian Games continues the action-filled romp through the sixth century BCE that began in Agent of Exiles 1: The League of Set, with the unlikely friends Samuel of Judea and Mehrnaz of Persia as your extremely deadly guides.</p>";
