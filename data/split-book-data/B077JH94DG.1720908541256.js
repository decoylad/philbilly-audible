window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In cycle three of the series, the Harbingers team investigates more mysterious and fascinating supernatural occurrences in Hollywood, a small town in North Carolina, and elsewhere. Can they keep the growing darkness at bay? </p> <p>This fast-paced and ongoing collection plays like your favorite TV series, with each linked episode written by a talented author. </p> <p>In Myers's \"Leviathan\", the team heads to Hollywood for a taping of the new TV pilot, <i>Live or Die, the Ultimate Reality</i>. Little do they realize the depths of darkness they are about to enter - a darkness that, unless they stop it, will soon spread across the globe. </p> <p>Frank Peretti's \"The Mind Pirates\" offers a rousing story featuring bizarre visions and memories of a murder, a kidnapping by 17th-century pirates, and an earring with mysterious powers. The team must overcome the ruthless scheming of an evil, hidden nemesis. </p> <p>In \"Hybrids\" from Angela Hunt, the sight of two children chills the team to their bones. Seeking rest and relaxation, the four friends must instead find answers to the arrival and mission of two mysterious black-eyed children. </p> <p>In \"The Village\" from Alton Gansky, a visit to a guarded and secretive small town in North Carolina becomes the most challenging mystery they've ever faced - as they race to solve a problem they barely understand before time runs out. </p> <p>Cycle three of the Harbingers series offers more suspense, more chills, and a deeper look into the battle for light in a growing darkness. </p>";
