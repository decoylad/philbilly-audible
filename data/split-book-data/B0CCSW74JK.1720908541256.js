window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An exciting standalone Cthulhu Casebooks narrative, a thrilling tale of mystery and dread, from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author.</b></p> <p>It’s 1929 and an aging Dr. John Watson, conscious of his imminent demise, finally sits down to write a fresh chronicle disclosing the true events behind his published accounts of Sherlock Holmes’s exploits. In these pages, Sherlock Holmes and his stalwart companion encounter reanimated corpses in Highgate Cemetery; a very different, though ever elusive, Irene Adler; tales of madness and murder in the frozen wastes of the north; grotesque organic machines; and much more. Each case brings the illustrious pair ever closer to the dramatic and terrifying truth about the mysterious aliens, the Mi-Go, and their plans for Earth …</p>";
