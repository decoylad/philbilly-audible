window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Simon R. Green returns to the \"bizarre and gleefully dangerous backdrop\" (Jim Butcher, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of the Dresden Files) of the Nightside with this landmark collection of short fiction.</b></p> <p>Welcome to the Nightside. It's the secret heart of London, beating to its own rhythm, pumping lifeblood through the veins of its streets and alleys hidden in eternal darkness, where creatures of the night congregate, and where the sun is afraid to shine. It's the place to go if you're looking to indulge the darker side of your natureâ€”and to hell with the consequences.</p> <p><i>Tales from the Nightside</i> presents ten macabre mysteries that shine a dim beam into the neighborhood's darkest corners to reveal things that should never come to light. Take a walk with such deadly and dangerous denizens of the Nightside as Razor Eddie, Dead Boy, and Larry Oblivion as they encounter things even more inhuman and inhumane than they are. And join John Taylor, the PI with a knack for finding lost things, as he confronts Sir Francis Varney, King of the Vampires.</p> <p><b>There may be nothing to be afraid of in the dark, but there's plenty to be afraid of in the Nightside . . .</b></p>";
