It's a place where the sun refuses to rise, where monsters and men walk side by side. And if you want something found in the Nightside, I'm your man.</p> <p>The editor of the Unnatural Inquirer—the Nightside's most notorious rag—has offered me one million pounds to find a man who claims to have evidence of the Afterlife stored on a DVD. The Inquirer made the guy a sweet deal. Then he and the disc vanished.</p> <p>I don't know if the disc is on the level—but for a million pounds, I'm willing to believe. Trouble is, someone else—someone very powerful—is on the trail, too. And who—or what—ever it is, is deadly determined to find the disc first . . .</p>";
