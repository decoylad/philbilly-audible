With Lewis out of the way, former Paragon Finn Durandal has led a silent coup to wrest control from the king and set himself up as the power behind the throne.</p> <p>But Durandal is not the Empire's biggest threat. The Terror that Owen Deathstalker prophesied nearly 200 years ago is almost upon them, and Owen is supposedly the only one who can save civilization from unspeakable horrors.

But with Finn in control of the empire's massive forces, he is outmanned and outgunned at every turn. Lewis must stay one step ahead of Finn's ever-expanding reach if he has any hope of discovering Owen's fate.</p>";
