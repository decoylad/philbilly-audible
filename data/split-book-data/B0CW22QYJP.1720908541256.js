Unfortunately, things changed while I was away.</p> <p>I brought with me an update to the system that spreads like a virus from person to person, bringing with it a new level to the Rebuild America System, politics. A presidential election, the results of which would give someone the power to adjust the system and bend it to their will.</p> <p>The war between the Horde and the Remnants grows more fierce every day. Border skirmishes are near constant, and men and women water the sands of the wastes with their blood. My people, Pott’s Field, are caught in the middle.</p> <p>Neutrality is getting harder, and it’s only a matter of time before war begins in earnest.</p> <p>Luckily war, unlike politics, is something I understand.</p> <p><b>Book 3 of this gunslinging LitRPG Apocalypse Series about a courier braving the irradiated wasteland.
