window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sudden appearance of a sinister black hole in the English countryside leads to a baffling murder investigation for Ishmael Jones. </p> <p>“The past is England’s dreaming, and not all of it sleeps soundly....”</p> <p>Ishmael Jones and his partner Penny have been dispatched to assist a group of scientists who are investigating a mysterious black hole which has appeared on a Somerset hillside. Could it really be a doorway to another dimension, an opening into another world?</p> <p>When one of the scientists disappears into the hole – with fatal consequences – Ishmael must prove whether it was an accident – or murder. But with no clues, no witnesses and no apparent motive, he has little to go on. Is there an alien predator at large, or is an all-too-human killer responsible? Only one thing is certain: If Ishmael does not uncover the truth in time, more deaths will follow....</p> <p>Performed by Scott McCormick, Laura C Harris, Zeke Alton, Lily Beacon, Jonathan Feuer, Bill Gillett, Karen Novack, Alejandro Ruiz, Tia Shearer.</p>";
