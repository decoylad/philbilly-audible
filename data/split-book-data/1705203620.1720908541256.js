His days are spent hunting for food for his family, praying for warmth, and trying to hide his strange silver eye that grants him dragon sight.</p> <p>When a stranger visits during the local Freedom Festival searching for a different kind of dragon, everything changes.</p> <p>Forced down the mountainside, Jason learns the truth of powers he'd only heard about in rumors. While running from deadly Dragon Souls, he finds he might have more of a connection to magic than only dragon sight. In order to save himself and stop the Dragon Souls, he must learn a truth about himself that leads him closer to the one thing he fears above all others: dragons.</p> <p>Somehow, he might be the only one able to protect them from the Dragon Souls, but how can he protect what he hates?</p>";
