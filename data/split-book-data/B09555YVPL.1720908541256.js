The Second Terror.</p> <p>A wealthy man dies of a heart attack at his London townhouse. Was he really frightened to death by ghosts?</p> <p>The year 1894. The Third Terror.</p> <p>A body is discovered at a Surrey country manor, hideously ravaged. Is the culprit a cannibal, as the evidence suggests?</p> <p>These three linked crimes test Sherlock Holmes’ deductive powers, and his skepticism about the supernatural, to the limit.</p>";
