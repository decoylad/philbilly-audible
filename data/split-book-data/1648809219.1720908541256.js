The Organisation believes an imposter has infiltrated the Group and they have instructed Ishmael to root him – or her – out. It’s not Ishmael’s only mission. The first agent sent by the Organisation has been found dead in her room, murdered in a horribly gruesome manner. Ishmael must also discover who killed his fellow agent, Jennifer Rifkin – and why. </p> <p>Dismissive of rumours that the legendary \"Coronach Creature\" is behind Jennifer’s death, Ishmael sets out to expose the human killer in their midst. But he must act fast – before any more Very Important People are killed.</p> <p>Performed by Scott McCormick, Laura C Harris, Yasmin Tuazon, Eric Messner, Steve Wannall, Marni Penning, Rose Elizabeth Supan, Dylan Lynch, Michael John Casey, Steven Carpenter, Gwen Grastorf, Alejandro Ruiz, Ken Jackson, Bradley Smith, James Lewis, Amanda Forstrom, Barbara Pinolini, Carolyn Kashner.</p>";
