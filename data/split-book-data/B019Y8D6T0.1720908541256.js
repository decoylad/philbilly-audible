window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Alternate history master Eric Flint returns to top form with an epic addition to the multiple <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Ring of Fire series. </p> <p>A cosmic accident sets the modern town of Grantville, West Virginia, down in war-torn 17th-century Europe, and a new nation is forged. Now after carving a place for itself among the struggling powers of Western Europe, Grantville must throw up its eastern bulwarks against Dark Age domination. But the challenge for the down-time Eastern European horde is just as great: how to crawl out of a deeper feudal shadow than any in the West - and step into the light of freedom. </p>";
