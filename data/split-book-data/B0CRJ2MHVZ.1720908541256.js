window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With a mysterious system, action, adventure, leveling and plenty of laughs, this Complete Series Boxset has everything LitRPG listeners could ask for!</b></p> <p>When Phac finds himself in a world of magic, monsters, and blue screens, he must fight tooth and nail to survive. Unfortunately, falling into an overpowered crab nest doesn’t help. Neither does homemade quicksand under his boots. Worst of all, a snarky blue screen insists on calling him “Phac.”</p> <p>Armed with wit, brawn, dynamite temper, and crab-themed powers, Phac will carve his own, adventurous path through the vibrant world of Peras. He will befriend sharp-tongued orcs, clash against manipulative masterminds, and stand up for what he believes in.</p> <p>In the end, he will either become a greater hero than the world deserves…or crustacean fast-food.</p> <p><b>Don't miss this Isekai LitRPG Series from Valerios, author of </b><b><i>Cultivator vs. System</i></b><b>, now in a full series bundle for the first time.</b></p>";
