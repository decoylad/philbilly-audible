window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After a few delays and without the benefit of a rehearsal, it looks like Fletch is finally getting hitched. It's a small affair - just a few friends, the bride's parents, the groom's mother, and, just maybe, his father. Except Fletch's father is supposed to be dead.</p> <p>But somebody delivered the letter, signed \"Fletch Senior\" and containing an invitation (and a pair of plane tickets) to visit the old man in Nairobi for the honeymoon. Never mind Fletch and his bride were planning a ski trip to Colorado.</p> <p>No sooner does the couple land in Africa then the search for Fletch's father begins. There's a murder at the airport, reports of the old man's incarceration, and the hospitality (and evasiveness) offered by Pop's best friend, who flies them across the continent, just a step or two behind - or maybe ahead of - the old rascal.</p>";
